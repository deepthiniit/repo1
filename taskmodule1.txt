1. note on JVM:
   JVM: JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
   It is an interpreter which is used to execute java progrmas(byte code) line by line.

2. note on primitive and non-primitive data types:
   primitive datatypes:it is the type of datatype used to store the value in memory
   there are 8 primitive datatypes in java:
   int-> byte, short, int, long
   float->float, double
   char-> char
   boolean-> bool
   non-primitive datatype:it is a datatype which contains objects as its reference,that doesnt
   not contain value at the begining.

3. ternary operators:The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. 
   The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result upon a true comparison,
   and the third is the result upon a false comparison. It is also the shortened way of using if-else
   statments.
syntax: max=num1>num2?num1:num2;

4. difference between JDK and JRE:
   JDk is used to develop and compile the java application.
   JRE is used to run the java application

5. differencdifference between compiler and interpreter:
        Compiler Takes Entire program as input	                Interpreter Takes Single instruction as input .
	Intermediate Object Code is Generated	                No Intermediate Object Code is Generated
	Conditional Control Statements are Executes faster      Conditional Control Statements are Executes slower
	Memory Requirement : More (Since Object Code is Generated)	Memory Requirement is Less
	Program need not be compiled every time	                Every time higher level program is converted into 
                                                                             lower level program
	Errors are displayed after entire program is checked	Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted (if any)
	Example : C Compiler	                                                  Example : BASIC
